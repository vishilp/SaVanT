SaVanT To Do
1. Show p-values on heatmap
2. Aglomerate clustering for heatmap
3. Z-score heatmap / mean-centered heatmap
4. Only show signficanty signatures
5. Only display top x (50?) signatures
6. Organize the code (move functions to different files)
7. Add on the ability to upload gene expression matrices
8. Exception handling (what to do if wrong doc formatting or don't upload matrix)
9. Gene Expression matrix format instructions
10. Currently importing all signatures to a dict, but maybe see if we can only import the ones needed

Much later
1. Work on signature display
2. Fix duplicate signature names 
3. Update signature database
